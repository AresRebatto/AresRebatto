### Who Am I
Hi. I am an 18-year-old Italian student attending the fifth year in a technical institute majoring in computer science.
My goal right now is to develop as many skills as I can to consider myself a developer and computer scientist worthy of the name.

If you would like, take a tour through my repositories to see some of my work and feel free to tell me what you think in private as well.
